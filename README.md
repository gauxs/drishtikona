## Introduction
### Problem Statement
To develop a solution allowing users to perform video-conferencing over internet. Keeping in mind that the solution will have potentially half a billion+ subscribers and will be used by government. Solution:
- Should scale up/down seamlessly based on load
- Should implement tight security measure to support high profile/sensitive meetings being attended by government personals
- Should be easy to use, to support users from all walks of life i.e. a farmer or a businessman
- Should have low carbon footprint i.e. energy consumption, to support low end devices

### Research & Development Work Done Till Date
- Multiple application already exists which solve this problem like Skype, Zoom, Cisco Webex
- Some solutions are completely software based like Zoom while some are a combination of both hardware + software like Cisco WebEx
- The underlying technology of streaming video/audio has been improved considerably
